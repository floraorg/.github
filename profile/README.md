Content creators on YouTube face significant challenges when collaborating with team members due to YouTube Studio's limited permission management capabilities. The current system only allows for full channel access, **creating security risks** and **workflow inefficiencies**. Creators must choose between:
1. Granting complete channel access to team members, risking potential misuse or unauthorized changes
2. Manually mediating all changes, creating bottlenecks and delays in content publication

### Core Issues We Solve
1. **Security Vulnerability**: Full access sharing exposes channels to potential misuse
2. **Workflow Inefficiency**: Manual mediation creates bottlenecks
3. **Limited Flexibility**: Inability to delegate specific tasks without compromising channel security
4. **Lack of Oversight**: No built-in approval system for changes
5. **Time Zone Constraints**: Global teams struggle with coordination due to access limitations
